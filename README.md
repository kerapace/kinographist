# kinographist

Kinographist is an attempt at cloning most of the base features of Letterboxd, a social film discovery site that allows users to catalog, rate, and review their watched and liked films.

## Letterboxd
Letterboxd features an extensive catalog of films populated via an external API and integrates information obtained so such as actors, plot summaries, streaming options into a compact user experience, as well as highly-customizable search and discovery features. In addition, Letterboxd contains social integration, allowing users to comment on reviews and create their own personal posts associated with their personal userpage. Kinographist plans to implement most of these features and mimic the site's styling, albeit on a much smaller scale.

## Kinographist again

As Letterboxd uses the [free, publically available tMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/), it was a pretty simple matter to ensure that I'd have all the film information I needed on the site I was making. As I was making a simple proof-of-concept site, I wanted to only show a small number of films so it wouldn't be prohibitively difficult to populate the site with review and list data. With that in mind, using the extensive tMDb searching options didn't make sense, so I went through the effort of trawling the API
